        <h2>Nauvoo</h2>

        <dl>
          <dt>Start</dt>
          <dd> At some point during the time that the saints were in Nauvoo Joseph Smith received his vision where the angel said he had to follow God's commandment to teach others about plural marriage.
            Joseph Smith went about slowly feeling out the people he trusted to see if they would be willing to follow the new commandment. There were several people including Brigham Young and Hyrum Smith
            who were told by Joseph Smith about the new commandment. Everyone who Joseph Smith explained the new commandment to was given a choice and was invited to sincerely pray to know 
            the truth for themselves. This led to a small number of saints who began to practice plural marriage in Nauvoo. 
          </dd>
          <dt>Opposition</dt>
          <dd> Many of the people Joseph taught were revolted by the idea of plural marriage as many people are revolted by the idea today. According to the Rocky Mountain Saints the 
            doctrine of plural marriage would lead more people to leave the church over the course of the next century than almost any other doctrine. Opposition came in many forms one of which 
            was from Joseph's wife. Emma Smith didn't agree with the practice of plural marriage at first and few thoughts of hers are recorded. Joseph did record that it was a huge disturbance in 
            their marriage. One source claims that Emma told them that she was easily jealous of Joseph having multiple wives. Dr. Esplin stated in class and I believe his words hold some truth that 
            to Emma everything in her life was public except her marriage with Joseph and to have that taken away would be very difficult. 
          </dd>
          <dt>Apostasy</dt>
          <dd>A very small number of members of the church during the time in Nauvoo began to use the rumors of plural marriage to lure women into have sexual relations outside
            of marriage. John Bennett was the main perpetrator in carrying out these actions. This led bennett and a few others to publicly denounce Joseph Smith in the form of printing press.
            These events would eventually lead to Joseph's death. This very public opposition led to much unrest in Illinois and led to public denouncement of polygamy by leaders of the 
            church. In Saints Volume 1 it mentions that leaders of the church publicly denounced polygamy while practicing plural marriage because to them they understood the two as different things.
            It is interesting that the public probably had a different idea of the difference between the two as well as many of the saints.

  <aside>
    <p class="asideFontSizeDecrease">They and the others who practiced plural marriage never referred to it as polygamy,
         which they considered a worldly term, not a priesthood ordinance. When Joseph or someone else condemned “polygamy”
          or “spiritual wifery” in public, those who practiced plural marriage understood that they were not referring to their covenant relationships. -Saints Volume 1</p>
