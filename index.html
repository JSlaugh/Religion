        <h2>Plural Marriage Over Time</h2>

        <dl>
          <dt>Kirtland</dt>
          <dd> Joseph Smith during hsi translation of the bible began to ask the Lord questions about the actions of prophets in the past.
          One of his concerns or questions was about the practice of having concubines or multiple wives by ancient prophets. The lord responded to Joseph's 
          question and instructed him the practice of plural marriage would one day return in the modern day. Joseph Smith did not want to practice plural marriage. 
          It took several years and many visitations from angels for Joseph Smith to final begin practicing plural marriage. 
          </dd>
          <dt>Nauvoo</dt>
          <dd> Joseph Smith received a visitation from an angel who told him that the Lord would remove him from the earth if he did not start to follow the Lord's commandments
            to practice plural marriage. Joseph Smith began finding individuals in whom he trusted to share the doctrine of plural marriage. He taught several individuals many of whom
            were Elder's in the church and several women as well. The church's position at the time was to keep plural marriage private and to inform as few people as possible 
            to avoid rising the ire of the surrounding populations.

          <dt>Utah</dt>
          <dd>After several years of living in Utah, Brigham Young as the prophet announced and revealed to the entire church Joseph Smith's revelations on plural marriage. He and the 
            quorum of the twelve established policies and procedures for the correct way in which the saints might practice plural marriage. This led to those who were already practicing plural
            marriage to be able to do so in public.
